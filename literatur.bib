  abstract      = {
    This paper presents the implementation of a new 3D simulator applied to the
    area of robotics. The simulator allows to analyze the performance of
    different schemes of autonomous and/or tele-operated control in structured
    environments, partially structured and unstructured. For robot-environment
    interaction is considered virtual reality software Unity3D, this software
    exchanges information with MATLAB to execute different control algorithms
    proposed through the use of shared memory. The exchange of information in
    real time between the two software is essential because the advanced
    control algorithms require a feedback from the robot-environment
    interaction to close the control loop, while the simulated robot updates
    its kinematic and dynamic parameters depending on controllability variables
    calculated by MATLAB. Finally, the 3D simulator is evaluated by
    implementing an autonomous control scheme to solve the problem of path
    following of a 6DOF robot arm, also the results obtained by implementing
    the tele-operation scheme for said robot are presented.
