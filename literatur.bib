              applied to the area of robotics. The simulator allows to analyze
              the performance of different schemes of autonomous and/or
              tele-operated control in structured environments, partially
              structured and unstructured. For robot-environment interaction is
              considered virtual reality software Unity3D, this software
              exchanges information with MATLAB to execute different control
              algorithms proposed through the use of shared memory. The exchange
              of information in real time between the two software is essential
              because the advanced control algorithms require a feedback from the
              robot-environment interaction to close the control loop, while the
              simulated robot updates its kinematic and dynamic parameters
              depending on controllability variables calculated by MATLAB.
              Finally, the 3D simulator is evaluated by implementing an
              autonomous control scheme to solve the problem of path following of
              a 6DOF robot arm, also the results obtained by implementing the
              tele-operation scheme for said robot are presented.},
